# Cricket Score Prediction using Machine Learning


## Project Overview

This project aims to predict cricket scores using machine learning techniques. Three different models, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, have been implemented and compared to determine the best model for score prediction.

## Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from [source name or link]. It includes various features such as team performance, player statistics, and match conditions that influence cricket scores.

## Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into the models, it was preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables. Data preprocessing code can be found in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

## Model Building

Three machine learning models were implemented to predict cricket scores:

1. **Decision Tree:** A decision tree-based model for score prediction. Code and details are available in `decision_tree_model.ipynb`.

2. **Random Forest:** A random forest ensemble model was developed to improve prediction accuracy. The code and details can be found in `random_forest_model.ipynb`.

3. **Linear Regression:** A linear regression model was also used for comparison. Code and details are provided in `linear_regression_model.ipynb`.

## Model Comparison

To determine the best model for cricket score prediction, model performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) were calculated and compared in the `model_comparison.ipynb` notebook.

## Getting Started

To run the code and experiments in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ajaysimha29/cricket-score-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data preprocessing and models.

## Usage

You can use the models for cricket score prediction by following the instructions in the respective model notebooks (`decision_tree_model.ipynb`, `random_forest_model.ipynb`, and `linear_regression_model.ipynb`).
